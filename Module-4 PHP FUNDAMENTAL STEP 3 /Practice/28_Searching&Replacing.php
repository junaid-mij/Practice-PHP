/**
 * Searching & Replacing:
 * 
 * str_replace()        ->The str_replace() function is a built-in string function in PHP that is used to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string with a new substring. It searches the $subject string for all occurrences of the $search string, and replaces them with the $replace string.
 *                        Syntax: str_replace(mixed $search, mixed $replace, mixed $subject, int &$count = null): mixed
 * str_ireplace()       ->The str_ireplace() function in PHP is similar to the str_replace() function, but it is case-insensitive. This means that it will search for the $search string in the $subject string, ignoring differences in case between the two strings.
 *                        Syntax: str_ireplace(mixed $search, mixed $replace, mixed $subject, int &$count = null): mixed
 * array(replace)       ->we can use multiple replace with array:
 *                        Syntax: str_replace(array('',''....),array('',''....),$string,$count);
 *
