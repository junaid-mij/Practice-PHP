 * strpos()         ->strpos() is a built-in PHP function that searches for the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It returns the numeric position of the substring if it is found, and false if it is not found.

 * stripos()        ->stripos() is a case-insensitive version of the strpos() function in PHP. It searches for the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string, but it does not consider the case of the characters in the search. The function returns the numeric position of the substring if it is found, and false if it is not found.
 *                    Syntax: stripos(string $haystack, string $needle, int $offset = 0): int|false
 * strripos()       ->strripos() is a case-insensitive version of the strrpos() function in PHP. It searches for the position of the last occurrence of a substring within a string, but it does not consider the case of the characters in the search. The function returns the numeric position of the substring if it is found, and false if it is not found.
 *                    Syntax: strripos(string $haystack, string $needle, int $offset = 0): int|false
