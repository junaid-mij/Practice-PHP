# Build a BMI Calculator using JavaScript and deploy it to Netlify

This is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their weight and height. The BMI is calculated using the standard formula - BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) \* height (m)). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is deployed to Netlify.

## Getting Started

To use the BMI calculator, you can simply visit the following URL:

https://your-netlify-url-here.com

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on user's weight and height
- Display the calculated BMI on the web page
- Allow users to reset the input fields and calculated result
- Custom fonts using Google Fonts
- Styling using CSS

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Netlify

## How to Deploy

1. Create a new repository on Github and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create an HTML file with a form containing two input fields with IDs of "weightInput" and "heightInput", and a button with an ID of "calculateBtn".
3. Using JavaScript, write a function that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person when the "calculateBtn" is clicked.
4. Display the BMI result on the web page.
5. Use CSS to style the form and the result. Add a background image to the form.
6. Add custom fonts using Google Fonts.
7. Create a new site on Netlify and connect it to your Github repository.
8. Deploy your site to Netlify.

## Conclusion

This simple web application demonstrates how to build a BMI calculator using JavaScript and deploy it to Netlify. The code can be easily customized to add more features or improve the design.
