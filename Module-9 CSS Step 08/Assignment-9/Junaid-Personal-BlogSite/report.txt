*Introduction:
In this report, I will detail the design and implementation of a personal blog using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The blog has multiple pages, including
a home page, a blog page, and a contact page. The blog meets all the requirements set for the assignment, and the development process involved 
overcoming some challenges.

*Design:
The design of the blog was planned on paper first, with rough sketches of each page. The home page has a header with the blog name, a navigation
bar, and a hero section with a call-to-action button. Below that, there are three featured blog posts with images and brief descriptions. The 
blog page has a similar header and navigation bar, with a list of all blog posts below. Each post has a thumbnail image, a title, and a brief 
excerpt. Finally, the contact page has a form for visitors to fill in their name, email, and message.

*Implementation:
The development of the blog started with the creation of the HTML templates for each page. Each page had a header, a navigation bar, and a footer.
The header and footer were created as separate files and included in each page to ensure consistency. Next, the hero section and the featured 
posts section were added to the home page. The featured posts were created as separate HTML files and included on the home page. The blog page 
was created with a loop in PHP that retrieved all the blog posts from a MySQL database and displayed them on the page.

The styling of the blog was implemented using CSS. A separate CSS file was created for each page to ensure modularity. The colors, fonts, and 
layout were kept consistent across all pages to maintain the blog's branding.

*Challenges:
One of the challenges faced during development was the implementation of the contact form. I had to use PHP to retrieve the form data and send 
it to the desired email address. I also had to implement server-side form validation to prevent spam and ensure that the user entered valid data. 
Another challenge was the creation of the blog post excerpt. I had to write a function in PHP to retrieve a truncated version of the post content 
and display it on the blog page.

*Overcoming challenges:
To overcome the challenges faced during development, I researched PHP form handling and validation techniques. I also studied the PHP documentation
to learn how to retrieve data from a MySQL database and display it on a web page. I spent time experimenting with different techniques until I 
found the best approach. I also referred to online resources and documentation to help me implement the desired functionality.

*Conclusion:
In conclusion, the personal blog was successfully created using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The blog meets all the requirements set for the assignment. 
The development process involved overcoming challenges such as implementing the contact form and creating the blog post excerpt. However, 
through research, experimentation, and referring to online resources and documentation, these challenges were overcome, resulting in a functional
and aesthetically pleasing blog.
