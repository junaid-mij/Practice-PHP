/**
 * Access-Modifiers: In object-oriented programming (OOP) with PHP, access modifiers are keywords that define the visibility of properties and methods in a class. There are three access modifiers available in PHP: public, private, and protected.
 * 
 * public       : A public property or method can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. This is the default visibility for properties and methods if no access modifier is specified.
 * private      : A private property or method can only be accessed within the class in which it is defined. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
 * protected    : A protected property or method can be accessed within the class in which it is defined, as well as any subclasses of that class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class or its subclasses.
 *
